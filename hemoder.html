			<h1>Hemoder</h1>
			<p>Hemoder is an app that helps to connect nearby hospitals to use one ROTEMÂ® machine, a rapid differential diagnostics system.</p>
			<p>This system can reduce unnecessary transfusions, re-operation and infection rates, hospital length of stay, total hospital costs, and mortality.</p>

			<h2>The Business Problem </h2>

			<p>After first validation and MVP development phase, it was necessary to redesign the app's aesthetics, fix usability problems, and code bugs for its official launch and implementation on hospitals.</p>

			<div class="spaceVert"></div>

			<h2>The Approach</h2>
			<p>The product team behind the MVP had their research on the hospital workers who would use the app.</p>

			<p>I structured this information in roles, tasks, and situations where the app would be used.</p>

			<p>I then translated this into goals and unique functionalities for each role.</p>

			<p>Hemoder is an app based on collaboration. So, it was essential to prioritize features that ensure communication and fluid interaction between parts, thus serving the common goal of patient health.</p>

			<div class="spaceVert"></div>

			<h2>The Process</h2>

			<p>We used the functioning app as a base to create the new version, so it wasn't necessary to develop wireframes.</p>

			<p>I designed the UI differentiating each part of the collaborative process with a unique color.  Also, I restructured the navigation to prioritize critical features, and I created a secondary menu based on similar content.</p>

			<p>Another crucial part of the process was to design technical information in a way to quickly visualize a diagnostic.</p>

			<div class="spaceVert"></div>

			<h2>The Results</h2>
			<p>Hemoder was installed in the first hospital and receive useful feedback for iteration that we could implement in the next update for future hospitals. Thanks to the detail for diagnostics, the app became a learning tool for doctors.</p>

			<div class="spaceVert"></div>

			<h2>Measuring Success</h2>
			<p>Although we didn't have any data to compare with a previous stage, the app was successfully received and implemented in hospitals. Starting its use immediately in real emergency cases achieving this way our goals.</p>
