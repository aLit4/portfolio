			<h1>Centro MÃ©dico Integral Fitz Roy <small>(CMIFR)</small></h1>
			<p>CMIFR is a clinic center specialized in occupational medicine and work accidents. They are an industry leader due to their range of services, infrastructure, and innovation.  </p>
			<p>They continuously seek to update their services to current trends and develop new businesses units to focus on improving health in the workplace.</p>

			<h2>The Business Problem </h2>

			<p>CMIFR main problems were misinformation on their website, unavailable content on mobile, lack of visibility on other channels, including search engines. These issues didn't reflect the company's high-quality services resulting in an overload call center with repeated inquiries and <strong>lost business opportunities</strong>.</p>

		<div class="workDetail-main">
			<h2>The Approach</h2>
			<p>I started this project by doing analysis and research. </p>

			<p>Due to budget constraints, I couldn't do user interviews for research. Instead, I analyzed the reviews and comments made on every profile of the company to understand the user's pain points. I also examined the most recurrent inquiries registered in the call center to outline this information on the website.  </p>

			<p>Then, I tested the company website to analyze every usability problem, unclear content, misleading structure, and unoptimized code. </p>

			<p>After I analyzed this information, I decided to implement a content-based strategy instead of a traditional pure marketing strategy. Although this approach seems slower at first, it has better results to create a more positive relationship with users and to position the brand as an expert.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="workDetail-main">
			<h2>The Process</h2>

			<p>For the strategy, I defined the goals for the project based on the business problems and some key indicators to measure progress. </p>

			<p>I created user personas to differentiate the needs and goals of the users interacting with the CMIFR. </p>

			<p>I divided this information into stages accordingly to the circumstances of every user touchpoint. </p>

			<p>With these stages in mind, I developed essential information needed for achieving each stages goals. </p>

			<p>I poured this content into a new corporate website, with a clear architecture, fixing all usability problems and with an experience designed for mobile. I also coded the website SEO-friendly. Also, I developed a company's blog to give useful information to the users and to post it on social media as a way to generate more traffic and interest to the website. </p>
