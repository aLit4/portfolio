			<h1>Paula Guagliardi</h1>
			<p>I am a <strong>Lead Product Designer</strong> who enjoys translating user insights into interfaces for <strong>products that positively impact people's lives.</strong></p>

			<p>I've been living in Berlin for over five years, focusing on <strong>complex applications for specialized domains</strong>, particularly in vision AI and MedTech.</p>

			<p>Throughout my career, I have helped organizations <strong>lead full design cycles and define feature implementation</strong>, ensuring alignment with the product vision. This involves cross-team collaboration, conducting research, and evaluating the impact of design decisions.</p>
			
			<p>The challenges I am most interested in addressing are rooted in <strong>learning, knowledge work, critical thinking, biases, privacy, and digital transformation</strong> to make technology accessible to everyone.</p>

			<p>I am always pushing myself to improve and <strong>value every opportunity to learn something new</strong>.</p>

			<p>I would love to connect and <strong>share ideas</strong>.</p>

				One of the greatest benefits of having my studio was the ability to work and travel. <br>In 2017, I did my very first Eurotrip and visited 21 cities and 10 countries for three months. I met many people who welcomed me into their homes, shown me their cities, and shared stories with me.<br><br>
				<strong>Traveling enriched my personal view and also gave me the chance to experience first hand being a user in need of good UX</strong>. Trying to understand different languages, using a lot of things for the first time, and having to read into situations quickly, allowed me to add another dimension to the way I think about product design. It was also the catalyst for moving to Berlin.

				One of the cool things I've already experienced here in Berlin was to attend the <strong>Nielsen Norman UX Conference</strong>. I joined two Workshops about Ideation and Design Thinking. Learning from the people who did so much for this field was something beyond my expectations.

			<h2>.Background</h2>
			<p>I started my career in 2005 in Buenos Aires, after graduating as a web designer. I began working in <strong>digital advertising</strong>, where I <strong>learned about design, code, branding, and how to think and communicate creative concepts</strong>.</p>

			<p>I worked at various agencies with different structures and sizes, where I learned different things.
				<ul>
					<li>In a small digital agency, I learned to <strong>wear different hats</strong> and to code everything I designed.</li>
					<li>In the bigger digital agency, I learned to work in a <strong>cross-functional team</strong>.</li>
					<li>In the traditional multinational agency, I learned how to integrate campaigns from <strong>other mediums into digital formats</strong>.</li>
					<li>In the global media network, I learned about <strong>strategy</strong> and how to <strong>lead</strong> projects.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>>While I enjoyed working in a creative environment, I was <strong>highly motivated when thinking about the user and their goals, content quality, and usability</strong>. However, the nature of the industry often meant these priorities weren't always at the forefront.</p>

			<p>Although I enjoyed working in a creative environment, I was highly motivated when thinking about the user and their goals, content quality, and usability</strong>. Still, due to advertising nature, this was never a priority.</p>

			<p>Aiming to work with other like-minded persons, <strong>I started my design studio, Furycat</strong> ðŸ˜¾. <strong>We developed digital strategies, social media campaigns, design websites, and e-commerces</strong> for companies like Herbalife, Kraft Foods, and Nespresso but also with small businesses and entrepreneurs. I found it <strong>rewarding to help small businesses thrive</strong>.</p>

			<p>I was also a <strong>digital partner to graphic design studios</strong> doing front-end development, interaction design, and consulting. These were <strong>long term relationships</strong> that continued throughout the entire time I had my studio.</p>

			<p>Furycat was a great experience for personal growth as well. I developed <strong>new skills to deal with the operational side of the business</strong>, like developing processes for managing projects and clients, and putting together flexible teams.</p>

			<p><strong>During this period, I started learning about User-Centered design processes and UX methodologies, discovering a whole new world, a magical world</strong>. âœ¨</p>

			<p>I realised how my clients could benefit from these methodologies, so <strong>I proactively began applying them to the projects</strong> getting a better response from both users and businesses. I used the feedback from the projects to find new topics and techniques to learn.</p>

			<p>As I continued to learn UX, I became more interested in experiencing the <strong>full process of product design</strong> by being part of a product team where I could share and learn from others.</p>

			<p>I started doing this at Blockinar, a startup developing blockchain-based products. <strong>I worked in a cross-functional team using agile methodologies to reach our goals. I defined the design brief and the projects' objectives and designed the UI and UX for our apps</strong>. I also outlined the design process for the company.</p>

			<p>The same year, my husband and I took the opportunity to move to Berlin. I saw this as a great chance to challenge myself, continue learning product design in a more mature context with broader applications, and <strong>explore different opportunities for my career</strong>.</p>

			<p>In the five years since, I've immersed myself in the UX and startup community. I earned a <strong>UX certification</strong> from the Nielsen Norman Group and have been focusing on complex applications for specialized domains, working for Hasty.ai, an end-to-end platform for <strong>vision AI</strong>.</p>

			<p>As a seed-stage startup, my work at Hasty involved wearing many hats, with the company's primary goal being to achieve <strong>product-market fit</strong>.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Crafting interactions for a Graphical User Interface (GUI)</strong> was one of the most fun and interesting experiences so far in my career.</p> 

			<p>After two years at <strong>Hasty</strong>, the company was acquired by <strong>CloudFactory</strong>, which gave me valuable insight into how businesses evolve during such transitions.</p>
			
			<p>In my current role at CloudFactory, I lead design efforts from concept to execution, including implementation oversight. <strong>This involves collaborating with stakeholders to define requirements, create interaction designs, apply patterns to solve complex workflows, and scope initiatives according to the product roadmap</strong>.</p>

			<p>These efforts also include <strong>conducting user interviews, usability testing, and desk research to inform design work. I also helped establish design and research practices for my team and the company</strong>.</p>

			<p>During this long journey, my <strong>curiosity has led me to continuously explore side projects</strong>, particularly in visual arts like photography and cyanotypes. I also have a list of future interests I'd like to pursue, including creative coding, data visualization, and playing the drums.</p>

			<p>Yes, this is a lot, but <strong>everything I've learned, and every interest I've pursued, has broadened my view of the world</strong>, improving my life and what I do. So, why not keep going?</p>
			
			<p>If, by any chance, you managed to get to the end of this, <strong>thank you</strong>.</p>
